0. read the string from the user and call it the input
1. tokenize the input by breaking apart on spaces 
1.a. look for shell variables by finding "$" characters, look up the values
     stored in those variables and put them into the command
2. look at first token and decide what to do
   a. decide if the first token is an executable file on the computer
      by looking in each location in the path variable PATH
      if it is run that with all the other tokens as its command line arguments
   b. if the first token "looks like a variable definition" NAME=VAL then 
      add that variable to the environment (or modify the variable if it exists)
   c. if we can't figure out what to do, complain about it
